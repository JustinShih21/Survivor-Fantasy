    "### Important: No Player Replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation uses **fixed rosters with no replacement**. Each team selects 7 contestants at the start (pre-merge). When a contestant is voted out, they are **not replaced**—the same 7 players are scored for the entire season. Eliminated players stop earning points (no survival, challenges, or tribal) but can still incur penalties (voted out). There is no merge repick in this simulation.\n",

    "\n",
    "This section explains the exact rules of each simulated game so you can verify the simulation is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monte Carlo simulation:** Each \"run\" generates one random season scenario. The same set of team rosters is then scored against that scenario. Total team-scenario pairs = (scenario runs) × (rosters per run) × (strategies).\n",
    "- **One scenario = one full season:** Boot order, challenge winners, idol finds/plays, etc. are determined once per scenario and stay fixed for all teams.\n",
    "- **One roster = one team:** Each team has a fixed 7-contestant roster. The same roster is scored against every scenario.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario Generation Rules (Per Season)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boot Order\n",
    "- **Determined once per scenario** using weighted random: each contestant's `survival_bias` (0–1) is their weight.\n",
    "- **Order is fixed:** First in boot order = episode 1 vote-out, etc. 21 eliminations total (24 → 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Team Immunity\n",
    "- **3 tribes (pre-merge):** 1st = +3, 2nd = +1, 3rd = -1\n",
    "- **2 tribes (swap phase):** 1st = +3, 2nd = +0\n",
    "\n",

    "- **2 tribes:** 1st = +2, 2nd = +0\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Individual Immunity (Post-merge)\n",
    "- **One winner per episode.** Weighted random using `challenge_ability`. **Winner gets +5.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vote Matched\n",
    "- When someone is voted out, a random **65–95%** of the remaining (non-eliminated) players are designated as having voted for that person (on the \"right side\" of the vote).\n",
    "- Each of those players gets +2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Voted Out\n",
    "- **Base penalty:** -4\n",
    "- **Pocket multiplier:** If the voted-out player had an idol/advantage in pocket, penalty = -4 × 2^(number of items). 1 item = -8, 2 items = -16.\n",
    "- **Per-vote penalty:** -1 × (votes received). Votes received: random 4–6 pre-merge, 5–9 post-merge.\n",
    "- **Total:** -4 × 2^pocket + (-1 × votes)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Idol Finds\n",
    "- **3–6 idols found per season** (random, more variability)\n",
    "- **Random episodes** (from episodes with tribals)\n",
    "- **Random finders** (contestants who find them)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Idol Plays (Success + Failure)\n",
    "- **Each idol find** can be played at a later tribal. **~55% success rate** per play.\n",
    "- **Success:** +7 points. **Failure** (played incorrectly): **-2 points**.\n",
    "- **Must occur after the find.** Only counted when there is a tribal that episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clue Reads\n",
    "- **1–4 clue-read events per season**\n",
    "- **1–2 readers per clue** (can be shared)\n",
    "- **Random episodes, random readers**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantage Plays (non-idol)\n",
    "- **0–2 successful plays per season**\n",
    "- **Random episode, random player**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategic Player of the Episode (+4)\n",
    "- **Replaces fake idol trick.** Each tribal where someone is voted out, one person from the `vote_matched` list is designated the **strategic driver** (the person who led the vote).\n",
    "- **Selection:** Random choice **weighted by `survival_bias`** (higher = more likely to be chosen).\n",
    "- **Points:** +4 to that player.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Voted Out with Idol in Pocket\n",
    "- **17% chance** when someone is voted out that they had 1+ items in pocket\n",
    "- **3% chance** (given they have an item) that they had 2 items\n",

    "### Scoring Logic (How Points Are Assigned to a Team)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each team roster and each episode:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Only roster members still in the game** earn positive points (survival, challenges, vote matched, advantages). Eliminated roster members earn nothing from that point on.\n",
    "2. **Voted out:** If a roster member is voted out this episode, the penalty is applied: `-4 × 2^pocket_items + (-1 × votes_received)`.\n",
    "3. **Survival:** Each roster member in `survived` (attended tribal and was not voted out) gets +2 (pre-merge) or +3 (post-merge). Survival is only awarded when a tribal occurred and someone was voted out.\n",
    "4. **Challenges:** Each roster member on the winning/losing tribe gets the corresponding team immunity/reward points. Individual immunity winner gets +5.\n",
    "5. **Vote matched:** Each roster member in the `vote_matched` list gets +2.\n",
    "6. **Advantages:** Clue readers (+1), idol players (+7), advantage players (+4), fake idol trickers (+4).\n",
    "7. **Placement:** At finale, roster members in final 3 get +5 each; winner gets +9.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Verify\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eliminations:** 13 tribals with votes (episodes 1–13). 18 − 13 = 5 remain at episode 14. Final three is randomly chosen from those 5; winner from those 3.\n",
    "- **Survival:** Pre-merge (1–9): +2 per survivor per tribal. Post-merge (10–13): +3 per survivor. Max pre-merge survival for one player: 9 × 2 = 18. Max post-merge: 4 × 3 = 12.\n",
    "- **Team challenges:** With 3 tribes, each tribe gets exactly one placement (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) per pre-merge episode. Each roster member gets one team immunity and one team reward result per pre-merge episode.\n",
    "- **Individual immunity:** Exactly one winner per post-merge episode (10–13).\n",

    "#### Boot Order\n",
    "- **Determined once per scenario** using weighted random: each contestant's `survival_bias` (0–1) is their weight.\n",
    "- **Order is fixed:** First in boot order = episode 1 vote-out, etc. 21 eliminations total (24 → 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Team Immunity\n",
    "- **3 tribes (pre-merge):** 1st = +3, 2nd = +1, 3rd = -1\n",
    "- **2 tribes (swap phase):** 1st = +3, 2nd = +0\n",

    "- **2 tribes:** 1st = +2, 2nd = +0\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Individual Immunity (Post-merge)\n",
    "- **One winner per episode.** Weighted random using `challenge_ability`. **Winner gets +5.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vote Matched\n",
    "- When someone is voted out, a random **65–95%** of the remaining (non-eliminated) players are designated as having voted for that person (on the \"right side\" of the vote).\n",
    "- Each of those players gets +2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Voted Out\n",
    "- **Base penalty:** -4\n",
    "- **Pocket multiplier:** If the voted-out player had an idol/advantage in pocket, penalty = -4 × 2^(number of items). 1 item = -8, 2 items = -16.\n",
    "- **Per-vote penalty:** -1 × (votes received). Votes received: random 4–6 pre-merge, 5–9 post-merge.\n",
    "- **Total:** -4 × 2^pocket + (-1 × votes)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Idol Finds\n",

    "- **Random episodes** (from episodes with tribals)\n",
    "- **Random finders** (contestants who find them)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Idol Plays (Success + Failure)\n",
    "- **Each idol find** can be played at a later tribal. **~55% success rate** per play.\n",
    "- **Success:** +7 points. **Failure** (played incorrectly): **-2 points**.\n",
    "- **Must occur after the find.** Only counted when there is a tribal that episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clue Reads\n",
    "- **1–4 clue-read events per season**\n",
    "- **1–2 readers per clue** (can be shared)\n",
    "- **Random episodes, random readers**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantage Plays (non-idol)\n",
    "- **0–2 successful plays per season**\n",
    "- **Random episode, random player**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategic Player of the Episode (+4)\n",
    "- **Replaces fake idol trick.** Each tribal where someone is voted out, one person from the `vote_matched` list is designated the **strategic driver** (the person who led the vote).\n",
    "- **Selection:** Random choice **weighted by `survival_bias`** (higher = more likely to be chosen).\n",
    "- **Points:** +4 to that player.\n",

    "#### Voted Out with Idol in Pocket\n",

    "### Scoring Logic (How Points Are Assigned to a Team)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each team roster and each episode:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Only roster members still in the game** earn positive points (survival, challenges, vote matched, advantages). Eliminated roster members earn nothing from that point on.\n",
    "2. **Voted out:** If a roster member is voted out this episode, the penalty is applied: `-4 × 2^pocket_items + (-1 × votes_received)`.\n",
    "3. **Survival:** Each roster member in `survived` (attended tribal and was not voted out) gets +2 (pre-merge) or +3 (post-merge). Survival is only awarded when a tribal occurred and someone was voted out.\n",
    "4. **Challenges:** Each roster member on the winning/losing tribe gets the corresponding team immunity/reward points. Individual immunity winner gets +5.\n",
    "5. **Vote matched:** Each roster member in the `vote_matched` list gets +2.\n",
    "6. **Advantages:** Clue readers (+1), idol players (+7), advantage players (+4), fake idol trickers (+4).\n",
    "7. **Placement:** At finale, roster members in final 3 get +5 each; winner gets +9.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Verify\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eliminations:** 13 tribals with votes (episodes 1–13). 18 − 13 = 5 remain at episode 14. Final three is randomly chosen from those 5; winner from those 3.\n",
    "- **Survival:** Pre-merge (1–9): +2 per survivor per tribal. Post-merge (10–13): +3 per survivor. Max pre-merge survival for one player: 9 × 2 = 18. Max post-merge: 4 × 3 = 12.\n",
    "- **Team challenges:** With 3 tribes, each tribe gets exactly one placement (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) per pre-merge episode. Each roster member gets one team immunity and one team reward result per pre-merge episode.\n",
    "- **Individual immunity:** Exactly one winner per post-merge episode (10–13).\n",

    "# Pricing System Improvement Report\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date:** February 19, 2025  \n",
    "**Purpose:** Document changes made to increase unique roster combinations and improve roster diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Three improvements were implemented to increase the number of viable, distinct roster combinations:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Change | Before | After |\n",
    "|--------|--------|-------|\n",
    "| **target_top5_sum** | $950,000 | $900,000 |\n",
    "| **price_increment** | $5,000 | $2,500 |\n",
    "| **Tie-breaking** | Deterministic (first match) | Random among ties |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Pricing Configuration (`config/pricing.yaml`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### target_top5_sum: $950,000 → $900,000\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:** With top 5 at exactly budget, there was no slack for tradeoffs. Lowering to $900K creates ~$100K of headroom, enabling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **6-player premium rosters** — A 6th mid-tier player can now fit under budget alongside 5 premium picks\n",
    "- **Swaps within premium tier** — e.g., swap one $170K player for a $145K player and add a value pick\n",
    "- **More viable combinations** — Multiple roster compositions can now hit the budget\n",
    "\n",
    "### price_increment: $5,000 → $2,500\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:** Finer granularity creates more distinct price points (37 vs 37 in range, but more precise rounding). This allows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- More precise budget allocation\n",
    "- Fewer players clustered at identical prices\n",
    "- More meaningful tradeoff decisions between similar players\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Roster Generator Tie-Breaking (`src/roster_generator.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiple players had identical scores (expected points, value ratio, etc.), the generator always picked the first in sorted order. This made strategies like `max_expected`, `value`, `balanced`, and `mid_tier` fully deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Changes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`generate_budget_roster`:** When picking by score, if multiple candidates tie for best score, choose randomly among them\n",
    "- **`_generate_premium_roster`:** When picking best by expected points (per tribe or fill slots), break ties randomly\n",
    "- **`_generate_stars_and_scrubs`:** When picking 2 stars by expected points, break ties randomly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect:** Strategies that previously produced the same roster every run can now produce variation when ties occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Simulation Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rosters per strategy:** Increased from 15 to 25 (in `run_pricing_simulation.py`) to better exercise tie-breaking and capture roster diversity\n",
    "- **Price estimation runs:** 2,000  \n",
    "- **Scenario runs:** 300  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before vs After Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Before | After |\n",
    "|--------|--------|-------|\n",
    "| **Unique roster compositions** | 29 | 30 |\n",

    "| **6-premium viable?** | No (fell back to 5) | Yes |\n",

    "### Strategy Behavior Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "| Strategy | Before | After |\n",
    "|----------|--------|-------|\n",
    "| **max_expected** | 5 players (c05, c07, c13, c21, c23), $950K | 6 players (c05, c11, c13, c20, c21, c23), ~$987K |\n",
    "| **six_premium** | 5 players (same as five_premium) | 6 players (c05, c11, c13, c20, c21, c23) |\n",
    "| **five_premium** | 5 players | 5 players (c05, c11, c13, c21, c23) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key improvement:** The `six_premium` strategy now successfully builds 6-player premium rosters instead of falling back to 5, validating that 6 premium players can fit under budget with the new pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## New Simulation Results\n",
    "\n",
    "See `pricing_report.md` and `pricing_analysis.json` in this directory for the full output of the latest run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unique rosters:** 30 (slight increase; more variety possible with additional rosters per strategy)\n",
    "- **6-premium rosters:** Now viable — max_expected, balanced, and six_premium all build 6-player rosters\n",
    "- **Price spread:** $80,000–$207,500 in $2,500 increments\n",
    "- **Strategy performance:** mid_tier (413.3 avg), random (411.0), stars_and_scrubs (403.7) remain competitive\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations for Further Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "If more roster diversity is desired:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increase rosters per strategy** — e.g., `--rosters 40` or higher\n",
    "2. **Flatten price curve** — Try `price_curve: 1.4` to compress the spread and create more mid-tier tradeoffs\n",
    "3. **Lower target_top5_sum further** — e.g., $850K to allow 6 premium players to fit more comfortably\n",
    "4. **Widen price range** — Lower `price_min` or raise `price_max` for more distinct tiers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Files Modified\n",
    "\n",
    "- `scripts/point_simulation/config/pricing.yaml` — target_top5_sum, price_increment\n",
    "- `scripts/point_simulation/src/roster_generator.py` — tie-breaking in generate_budget_roster, _generate_premium_roster, _generate_stars_and_scrubs\n",
    "- `scripts/point_simulation/run_pricing_simulation.py` — default rosters per strategy (15→25), dynamic price increment in report\n"

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Previous Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "The original simulation used 8 strategy-based roster generators. Most strategies were deterministic, producing the same roster every run. Only ~30 unique rosters were tested across 200 generated entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### New Approach: Uniform Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enumerate** all valid roster combinations (min 1 per tribe, under budget)\n",
    "2. **Sample** N rosters uniformly from this set (rejection sampling with deduplication)\n",
    "3. **Score** each sampled roster across 300 Monte Carlo season scenarios\n",
    "4. **Report** total valid options, rosters tested, and score distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`src/roster_enumerator.py`**: `count_valid_rosters()`, `sample_valid_rosters()`\n",
    "- **CLI:** `python run_pricing_simulation.py --sample-rosters 500`\n",

    "\n",
    "- Sampled rosters span a wide range (21–801 points), reflecting the diversity of valid team compositions\n",
    "- Average cost ($761K) is below budget, as many valid rosters use mid-tier players\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pricing supports substantial diversity:** 426K+ valid team options give players meaningful choice without overwhelming complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **7-player rosters are most common:** 286K of 426K options (67%) use all 7 roster slots, enabling deeper rosters with value picks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sampling enables broad testing:** Testing 500 uniformly sampled rosters provides a representative view of the strategy space vs. the previous ~30 strategy-derived rosters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Score variance is high:** Min 21 to max 801 points across scenarios indicates roster composition and scenario outcomes both matter significantly.\n",

    "## How the Simulation Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules of Each Simulated Game\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial roster:** 7 players, min 1 per tribe, under $1M budget. Built using strategy (value, max_expected, mid_tier, etc.).\n",
    "2. **No replacement (fixed):** When a roster member is voted off, they are not replaced. The roster shrinks; eliminated players stop earning points but can still incur voted-out penalty.\n",
    "3. **Replacement (replace):** When a roster member is voted off, if viable replacements exist (affordable with freed budget, within value tolerance), the best-value option is added. A **-10 point penalty** is applied per replacement.\n",
    "4. **Captain (required):** Every episode, captain = highest expected pts among active roster. Captain earns **2x points** for that episode only.\n",
    "5. **Price evolution:** Prices update after each tribal (performance delta, diversity compression, season inflation). All rosters in a scenario see the same price evolution.\n",
    "6. **Scoring:** Survival, challenges, tribal, advantages, placement. Same point values as production config.\n",
