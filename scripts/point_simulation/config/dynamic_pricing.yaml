# Dynamic (Episode-Reactive) Pricing Configuration
# Demand-based model: prices reflect expected demand from performance.
# Strong performers (immunity, vote matched, survival) → demand up → price up.
# Weak performers (voted out, poor challenges) → demand down → price down.
# No universal inflation; prices differentiate based on performance.

# How much prices move per episode (0.05 = ~5% max move; slower, more stable)
price_reactivity: 0.05

# Diversity compression: 0 = no homogenization; prices stay differentiated by performance
diversity_compression_base: 0
diversity_compression_late: 0

# Value tolerance: base 10%; widens when compressed or late-season
replacement_value_tolerance_base: 0.10
replacement_value_tolerance_max: 0.18   # Cap for adaptive widening

# Season progress thresholds (remaining players)
late_season_threshold: 12   # Below this = late season
highly_compressed_ratio: 0.35   # price_range/median < this = highly compressed

# Season inflation: 1.0 = disabled. Prices stay demand-based, no universal rise.
merge_episodes: 12          # Tribal episodes before merge (calibrated to merge_at 11-12)
merge_price_multiplier: 1.0  # No inflation; demand-driven only
merge_budget: 1780000       # Budget at merge
target_merge_valid_pct: 0.70 # ~70% of combos valid at merge
