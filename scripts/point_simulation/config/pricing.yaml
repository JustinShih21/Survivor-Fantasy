# Pricing System Configuration
# Phase 1: Initial team building under budget
# Roster: exactly 7 players required

budget: 1000000
roster_min: 7  # Exactly 7 players required
roster_max: 7

# Price bounds (dollars)
price_min: 100000   # Higher floor = more expensive cheapest players
price_max: 260000
price_increment: 2500   # Finer granularity for more unique roster combinations

# Monte Carlo runs for expected points estimation
price_estimation_runs: 2000

# Price scaling: top 7 by expected points must EXCEED budget (can't own all 7 premium)
target_top7_sum: 1200000   # 7 premium > budget - impossible to buy all top 7
# Calibrate so ~65% of team combos are valid under budget (35% excluded; ok to have fewer viable)
target_valid_pct: 0.65
price_curve: 1.8  # Exponent for non-linear mapping (higher = more spread)
